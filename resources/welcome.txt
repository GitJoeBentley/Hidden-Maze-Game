Hidden Maze Game

The goal of this game is to traverse a hidden maze starting in the upper left corner and 
proceeding to the lower right corner.  Along the way you will collide with solid walls (black)
and rubber walls (magenta).  The solid walls will give you a bruise and you cannot proceed 
through them.  A rubber wall will bounce you back to a random location.

You will lose the game if you take more than 60 seconds to traverse the maze or
if you receive 50 bruises.  Points are awarded as you progress through the maze.

The maze is flashed for 1 second at the beginning of the game.  You can also request a 1 second 
flash using the F1 key.  That will cost you one bruise and one point.  The flash will also cause 
one solid wall and one rubber wall to be added to the maze, and you will be bounced back to some
random location.

Good luck.
